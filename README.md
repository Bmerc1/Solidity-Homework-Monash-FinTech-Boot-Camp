# Solidity-Homework-Monash-FinTech-Boot-Camp

This repository contains Solidity code for three smart contracts that handle compensation distribution in one of three ways:

Associate Profit Splitter - splits total compensation distribution between all employees equally
Tiered Profit Splitter - splits total compensations distribution between employees differently based on role
Deferred Equity Plan - distrbutes an equal number of shares to an employee over four years
This should be run over the Kovan Ethereum testnet.

LEVEL ONE: This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently. The before and after account images are listed in the testing contract section
